    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken.</p>
    This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!
    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
           <h3> Make the Breading</h3>
            Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper in a zip-top bag. Seal the bag and shake until well-combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Dredge the Chicken</h3>
            <p>Pour buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until it's completely soaked in buttermilk.</p>
            <p>Place the soaked chicken in the bag with flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat.</p>
            Transfer the coated chicken to a baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a paste-like consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fry the Chicken</h3>
            <p>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet,</p>
            and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the chicken on paper towels.
